My goal was to understand if height, weight and BMI of the athletes would affect the performance in a game.
The performance was divide in high and low performance in order to apply an independent samples t-test.

Question: Do the physical characteristics affect the performance in a game?

1st H0: Physical characteristics of a squad do not affect the result obtained in a game

2nd H0: Physical characteristics of a squad do not affect the scored goals in a game

3rd H0: Physical characteristics of a squad do not affect the conceded goals in a game

4th H0: Physical characteristics of a squad do not affect how goals are scored in a game

5th H0: Physical characteristics of a squad do not affect how goals are conceded in a game

Results: We don't reject the five hypothesis, so an athletes height, weight and BMI do not affect the performance in a game.

After this statistical analysis, a tableau dashboard was made to coach in order for him to better understand his squad statistics.
